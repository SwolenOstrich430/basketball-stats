# basketball-stats

## Overview 
This is an app that I'm working on with my brother to get better insights into the development of younger NBA players. Currently, there are many apps that provide data related to player performance but no free features that you can easily use to gain more complex insights into game-by-game development and general trends. 

Currently, we're determining the basic reports that we're interested in creating, and I'm defining our basic schema and mining data from different sources available for free.
